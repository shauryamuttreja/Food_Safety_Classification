# Food_Safety_Classification

We want to predict if a facility (restaurant or other) will pass or fail in the food inspection visit by a staff member from the Chicago Department of Public Health. This is achieved by performing several data mining tasks on the data set such as data preprocessing, attribute selection, data classifier modelling and performance comparison. Result (Not ready, no entry, pass, pass with conditions, pass, fail) is the class attribute.
